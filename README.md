# OptionPricing
Two option pricing methods compared
+ Option_Pricing_Model1 utilizes the Black-Scholes formula and determines an option price based on historical data. 
+ Option_Pricing_Model2 utilizes Euler Discretization to discount back 10000 possible option prices generated by Monte Carlo simulation.
+ The two models use the same security, time frame, risk-free rate, etc. 
+ The difference between the obtained values is minor, yet possibly significant depending on the principal invested.
